*obs: Still the dataset and the company are real, the business problem is ficticious. The dataset was collected from [Kaggle]*


### Business Problem

  Rossmann is a drugstore chain that operates over 3000 stores in 7 European country. Rossmann's CFO required from the managers a forecast of the sales of each store, because he needs to assure that will have enough budget to make the renovation of them. 
  
  The **Data Science** project is focused on solving the following: 
  
  * Delevop a sales prediction for next 6 weeks for each store to ensure taht budget 
  * Deploy the model of predictions on a Telegram Bot
 

### Business Assumption


### Solution Strategy

**Step 01. Data Description.** The goal is to use statistcs metrics to identify data outside the scope of the business

**Step 02. Feature Engineering.** Derive new attributes based on the original variables to better describe the phenomenon that will be modeled 

**Step 03. Data Filtering.** Filter rows and select columns that do not contain information for modeling or that do not match the scope of the business

**Step 04. Exploratory Data Analysis.** Explore the data to find insights and better understand the impact of variables on model learning 

**Step 05. Data Preparation.** Prepare the data so that the Machine Learning models can learn specific behavior.

**Step 06. Feature Selection.** Selection of the most significant attributes for training the model

**Step 07. Machine Learning Modeling.** Machine Learning model training

**Step 08. Hyperparameter Fine Tuning.** Choose the best values for each of the parameters of the model selected from the previous step 

**Step 09. Convert Model Performance to Business Values.** Convert the performance of the Machine Learning model into a business result

**Step 10. Deploy Model to Production.** Publish the model in a cloud environment so that other people or services can use the results to improve the business decision
